# `<FormPage/>`

The form page that is rendered sequentially based on the context set by the `<Button/>` component:
- `children: ReactNode | ((validators: ValidatorContext, data: any, fieldSetter: (name: string, value: any) => void, currentPage: number, pageSetter: Dispatch<SetStateAction<number>>) => ReactElement)` - the content of the form page. These are meant to be the input fields of your form.
- `style?: CSSProperties` - the style to be passed on to the form page component.
