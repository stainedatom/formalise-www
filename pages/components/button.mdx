# `<Button/>`

The button with a custom `onClick` listener that allows for easy navigation between pages and access values on page change.
- `onClick: (data: any, e: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => (void | typeof NextPage | typeof PrevPage)` - the function called on the current form data and the mouse event. If ever it returns `NextPage`, the form transitions to the next page. If it returns `PrevPage`, the form transitions to the previous page.

and then props from exclusively one of the following sets of props:

- `as: ReactElement<any>` - the text area component to be rendered. If `onClick` is a prop of this component, it is ignored.
- the React-extended props of the native HTML text area element
