# `<Input/>`

The input components that Formalise internally listens and attaches values to the corresponding field names:
- `name: string` - *required* the name corresponding to the `<Form/>`'s `initialValue` prop key to which the input's value is attached.
- `type: string` - *required* the type property to be passed on to the native HTML input element.

and then props from exclusively one of the following sets of props:

- `as: ReactElement<any>` - the input component to be rendered. If `name` or `type` is a prop of this component, it is ignored.
- the React-extended props of the native HTML input element
