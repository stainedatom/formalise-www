# `<FieldsArray/>`

A sub-form with its own set of inputs that can be dymanically added to the main form:
- `name: string` - the name corresponding to the `<Form/>`'s `initialValue` prop key to which the input's value is attached.
- `children: ReactNode | ((index: number, length: number) => ReactElement)` - the content of the sub-form of which multiple instances could be added. `Field` components *must* be a direct child in order for it to work as expected.

The `name` property of the `initialValues` object corresponding to the `FieldArray`'s name is an array of objects whose property names correspond to the inputs that are members of the `FieldArray`. As an example:

```ts filename="initialValues"
{
  ...
  list: [{
    inputA: '',
    inputB: ''
  }, {
    inputA: '',
    inputB: ''
  }]
}
```

```ts filename="FieldArrayExample.tsx"
<FieldArray name='list'>
  <Field name='inputA' as='input'/>
  <Field name='inputB' as='input'/>
</FieldArray>
```

Two members will be rendered by default because `list` in the object `initialValues` is an array of two elements.
