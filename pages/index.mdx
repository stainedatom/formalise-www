# Overview

``` filename copy
npm i @panhaboth/formalise
```

Building complex forms on the web can sometimes be intimidating. One thinks not only of how data is passed on to different parts of the application logic, but also of the validation in between.

**Formalise abstracts much of this away from you, so that you can focus only on the things that might differ from form to form.**

## Motivation

In building Formalise, I intend to create the most **complete** and **flexible** abstraction layer for form composition. But what makes an abstraction layer complete and flexible?

A form abstraction layer is complete to the extent that it exhaustively identifies the set of all things that fundamentally make a form, a form. Flexibility ensures that the features that fall outside this set are nevertheless possible to implement. Flexibility-oriented APIs are those that provide extensions beyond fundamental features.

Still, being flexible and complete, I believe, is not enough. Heck, if completeness and flexibility are all there is to it, then we would not need to derive layers of abstraction beyond plain JavaScript, or even beyond machine code by extension. I intend Formalise to be a *good* abstraction layer, too, providing easy-to-use, declarative API for a painless developer experience.

Some examples of *fundamental features*:
- A state for a form input listens to at least one input, and that is itself.
- Every field array should have a feature to dynamically generate more fields.
- Forms are meant to have its data submitted to a server.

Some examples of *special features*:
- A form input might need to listen to other inputs, so that it can dynamically change value or shape.
- Forms/field arrays have different fields and field names.
- A submit button might need to cause a special side effect on the front-end.

## Walkthrough

Formalise comes equipped with components that work seamlessly with one another through an *underlying form context*,
so that you don't have to manually tie them together each and every time you construct a form.
Below is an example of a simple form composed using Formalise's standard API, omitting the magic of stylesheets:

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx"
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, NextPage, PrevPage } from '@panhaboth/formalise';

export default function YourForm(){
  return (
    <Form initialValues={{email: '', password: '', question: 'a', answer: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      <FormPage>
        <Field as='input' name='email' type='text' placeholder='Email'/>
        <Field as='input' name='password' type='password' placeholder='Password'/>
        <Button onClick={() => NextPage}>Continue</Button>
      </FormPage>
      <FormPage>
        <Field as='select' name='question'>
          <option value='a'>What's your birthday?</option>
          <option value='b'>In what town were you born?</option>
        </Field>
        <Field as='input' name='answer' type='text'/>
        <Button onClick={() => PrevPage}>Continue</Button>
        <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
      </FormPage>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

<br/>

import Form1 from '../components/Form1'

<Form1/>

<br/>

The `Form` component looks for `FormPage` components as children, and starts by rendering the first instance of `FormPage` that it encounters. Navigation into other `FormPage` components is achieved either by using the reserved function names `NextPage` and `PrevPage` for sequential navigation, or by using the exposed page setter function which we shall see in a moment.

### Intercepting form data on the fly

Now imagine that you wish to perform some server-side validation on the first page before allowing the user to proceed to the next. Formalise makes this easy by adopting a widely-used component design pattern called *children as a function*.

While `FormPage` components can accept the standard `ReactNode` as children, it can also accept a function that returns a React fragment containing the `ReactNode`. This function accepts as parameters the following objects in particular order:
- A validators object (usage coming soon)
- **A data object containing the current input values**
- A field setter function to manually set input states
- The page that is currently active
- A page setter function to navigate into other pages.

The second parameter may be used to access the available form values on the fly, as in the following example:

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx" {17,22-24}
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, NextPage, PrevPage } from '@panhaboth/formalise';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function YourForm(){
  const [ error, setError ] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const validate = (obj) => {
    if(obj.email === 'kun@home.com') return true;
    else return false;
  }

  return (
    <Form initialValues={{email: '', password: '', question: 'a', answer: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      <FormPage>
        {(validators, data) => <>
          {error ? <ErrorMessage message={error}/> : null}
          <Field as='input' name='email' type='text' placeholder='Email'/>
          <Field as='input' name='password' type='password' placeholder='Password'/>
          <Button onClick={() => {
            const passed = validate({email: data.email, password: data.password});
            if(passed) return NextPage;
            else setError('The email does not match. Try entering kun@home.com to access the next page on this form.');
          }}>Continue</Button>
        </>}
      </FormPage>
      ...
    </Form>
  )
}
```

<br/>

import Form2 from '../components/Form2'

<Form2/>

<br/>

Try entering some text and click *Continue*. A simple error message is rendered unless the `email` field has a value of `kun@home.com`. With this ability to hoist data around into custom logic within your form, the possibilities are truly limitless.

Imagine now that you wish to dynamically render the some field based on the value of other fields. In the example below, we will switch the input type of a field between `date` and `text` depending on a previous selection by the user.

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx" {15}
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, NextPage, PrevPage } from '@panhaboth/formalise';

export default function YourForm(){
  return (
    <Form initialValues={{email: '', password: '', question: 'a', answer: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      ...
      <FormPage>
        {(validators, data) => <>
          <Input as='select' name='question'>
            <option value='a'>What's your birthday?</option>
            <option value='b'>In what town were you born?</option>
          </Input>
          <Input name='answer' type={data.question === 'a' ? 'date' : 'text'}/>
          <Button onClick={() => PrevPage}>Continue</Button>
          <Button>Submit</Button>
        </>}
      </FormPage>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

<br/>

import Form3 from '../components/Form3'

<Form3/>

<br/>

The `data` object is accessible at any time, anywhere on the form page. The type of the `input` whose `name` prop is `answer` now changes conditionally on which question the user selects.

### Intercepting the `onChange` event listener

There is still a minor inconvenience in our form. Try entering any date as an answer when the birthday question is selected. Now, change the question to the one on birth town. The state of the `answer` field retains as text. While this might not make for the best user experience, Formalise comes equipped with an easy way to reset, or alter anyhow for that matter, field states upon changing the state of some other field.

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx" {11-13}
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, NextPage, PrevPage } from '@panhaboth/formalise';

export default function YourForm(){
  return (
    <Form initialValues={{email: '', password: '', question: 'a', answer: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      ...
      <FormPage>
        {(validators, data, setField) => <>
          <Input as='select' name='question' onChange={() => {
            setField('answer', '');
          }}>
            <option value='a'>What's your birthday?</option>
            <option value='b'>In what town were you born?</option>
          </Input>
          <Input name='answer' type={data.question === 'a' ? 'date' : 'text'}/>
          <Button onClick={() => PrevPage}>Continue</Button>
          <Button>Submit</Button>
        </>}
      </FormPage>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

<br/>

import Form4 from '../components/Form4'

<Form4/>

<br/>

Notice now that changing the `question` field resets the value of the `answer` field. Formalise allows you to provide `onChange` listeners to your fields without impacting its ability to listen for changes internally and correctly attaching it to the relevant state in context.

### Displaying page progression

Formalise allows you to implement your own page progression component very easily if you utilise its children as a function rendering approach. The actively rendered page is available for you to pass on as props to your custom page progression component, as in the example below:

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx" {10,18}
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, NextPage, PrevPage } from '@panhaboth/formalise';

export default function YourForm(){
  return (
    <Form initialValues={{email: '', password: '', question: 'a', answer: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      <FormPage>
        {(validators, data, setField, currentPage) => <>
          <PageDisplay total={2} current={page + 1}/><br/>
          <Field as='input' name='email' type='text' placeholder='Email'/>
          <Field as='input' name='password' type='password' placeholder='Password'/>
          <Button onClick={() => NextPage}>Continue</Button>
        </>}
      </FormPage>
      <FormPage>
        {(validators, data, setField, currentPage) => <>
          <PageDisplay total={2} current={page + 1}/><br/>
          <Input as='select' name='question' onChange={() => {
            setField('answer', '');
          }}>
            <option value='a'>What's your birthday?</option>
            <option value='b'>In what town were you born?</option>
          </Input>
          <Input name='answer' type={data.question === 'a' ? 'date' : 'text'}/>
          <Button onClick={() => PrevPage}>Continue</Button>
          <Button>Submit</Button>
        </>}
      </FormPage>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

import Form5 from '../components/Form5'

<Form5/>

Here, the component `PageDisplay` is a particular implementation of a progression bar that utilises the actively rendered page and the total number of pages. On top of this, a page setter function is available as the fifth and final parameter accepted by the child as a function. This page setter function may be used to jump around in your form, from page to page.

### Generating dynamic forms

Dynamic forms allow the user to add *structured* input that in the form data would correspond to an array. For example, let us mock a simple email invitation form that would allow us to send an email to multiple addresses of our choice. This feature is especially powerful when using it in the children as a function pattern, allowing access to the current index and length in that order.

```tsx filename="YourForm.tsx"
import { Form, FormPage, Field, Button, Push, Delete } from '@panhaboth/formalise';

export default function YourForm(){
  return (
    <Form initialValues={{invitees: [{name: '', email: ''}], message: ''}}
          onSubmit={(data, e) => {alert(JSON.stringify(data))}}
    >
      <FormPage>
        <FieldsArray name='invitees'>
          {(index, length) => <> 
            <Field as='input' name='name' placeholder={`Person ${index + 1}`}/>
            <Field as='input' name='email' placeholder={`Email`}/>
            {index !== 0 && <Button onClick={() => Delete}>Remove</Button>}
          </>}
        </FieldsArray>
        <Field as='textarea' name='message' placeholder='Message'/>
        <Button onClick={() => Push('invitees')}>+ Add Invitees</Button>
      </FormPage>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

import Form6 from '../components/Form6'

<Form6/>

The `FieldsArray` component relies on its member `Field`s being its direct children and a non-empty array as its value, so that there exists a template for it to copy over to a new member when the `Push` function is called.
